# Block 3: Working with GitHub Repositories

## Overview
In Block 3, you'll work with real-world open source repositories to practice:
- Exploring unfamiliar codebases with Claude Code
- Implementing fixes and features
- Using Claude as a QA tester (browser, CLI, API testing)
- Contributing to open source projects

## What You'll Learn
- Navigate and understand new codebases quickly
- Fix bugs in unfamiliar code
- Test your changes like a human would
- Work with different types of applications (web apps, CLIs, APIs)

## Team Repositories
Each team will receive a specific repository handout with:
- Repository URL and setup instructions
- 3 issues to fix (easy → medium → advanced)
- Testing approaches specific to your project type
- Examples of Claude testing commands

## Materials Coming Soon
Your team-specific handout will be distributed at the beginning of Block 3.

## Timing
- **Start:** After lunch break
- **Duration:** 90 minutes
- **Focus:** Real-world development with AI assistance
