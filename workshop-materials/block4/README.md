# Block 4: AI Agent Interaction Patterns

## Overview
Block 4 introduces powerful patterns for working with AI agents at scale:
- Pattern recognition and selection
- Building reusable command libraries
- Working with sub-agents for parallel processing
- Creating decision frameworks for pattern usage

## The 5 Core Patterns
1. **Iterative Human-in-the-Loop (HIL)** - You've been using this!
2. **Reusable Commands** - Your personal toolbox
3. **Sub-Agent Pattern** - NEW! Scale with specialized agents
4. **Prompt Workflows** - Advanced orchestration
5. **Wrapper MCP Server** - Enterprise integration

## What You'll Practice
- 15 minutes on each of the first 3 patterns
- Hands-on exercises with your code
- Pattern combination strategies
- Decision framework creation

## Key Takeaway
> "Start simple, scale when needed"

Most problems are solved with HIL and Reusable Commands. Sub-Agents are your Swiss Army knife for complex tasks.

## Materials Coming Soon
- Pattern Gallery handout with examples
- Practice exercises for each pattern
- Decision framework template

## Timing
- **Start:** After afternoon break (around 15:00)
- **Duration:** 90 minutes
- **Focus:** Mastering AI interaction patterns
